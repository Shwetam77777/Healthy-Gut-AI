🎯 Healthy-Gut-AI
AI-Powered Medical Content Generation System

This repository contains my solution for Problem 1 of the Software Engineer Assignment.
It demonstrates my ability to work with:

🔹 LLM prompt engineering

🔹 n8n workflows

🔹 SEO optimization

🔹 Readability + keyword metrics

🔹 GitHub version-control

🔹 Modular and scalable AI pipelines

🧠 Project Purpose

Healthy-Gut-AI automatically generates medically accurate, SEO-optimized, and readability-checked articles on gut health topics using:

✨ LLM Prompts

✨ JS Metrics Scripts

✨ n8n Automation

✨ Google Sheets Inputs

This showcases real workflow automation + AI engineering skills.

💻 **Quick Start (Standalone):**

Run the example script to see metrics in action:

```bash
node example_standalone.js
```

Or use the metrics scripts directly:

```bash
# Keyword density
node metrics/keyword_density.js "<article text>" "<keyword>"

# Readability check  
node metrics/readability_check.js "<article text>"
```

✍️ Prompt Details
🔹 Prompt 1 — Medical SEO Article Generator

Designed to create:

Medically accurate articles

Pillar (2500–3000 words) or Supporting (1000–1500 words)

Structured headings

Comparison tables

Diet recommendations

Keyword optimization

Medical disclaimers

🔹 Prompt 2 — Geo-Optimized SEO Enhancer

Adds:

Location-based optimization

Meta description

URL slug

FAQs

Schema (JSON-LD)

Featured snippet improvements

CTAs

🧮 Metrics Scripts
📌 keyword_density.js

Calculates:

Total words

Keyword count

Keyword density (%)

Ensures SEO quality.

✅ **Supports both n8n workflows and standalone Node.js execution**

**Usage:**
- **n8n:** Automatically uses `$json.optimized_article_markdown` and `$json.primary_keyword`
- **Standalone:** `node metrics/keyword_density.js "<article>" "<keyword>"`

📌 readability_check.js

Calculates:

Flesch Reading Ease score

Sentence complexity

Syllables per word

Ensures the article is readable for a general audience.

✅ **Supports both n8n workflows and standalone Node.js execution**

**Usage:**
- **n8n:** Automatically uses `$json.optimized_article_markdown`
- **Standalone:** `node metrics/readability_check.js "<article>"`

⚙️ Workflow Overview (n8n)
1️⃣ Google Sheet Input

topic

primary_keyword

geo_target

article_type

2️⃣ Workflow 1

➡ Outline generator

3️⃣ Workflow 2

➡ Draft generation using Prompt 1

4️⃣ Workflow 3

➡ Optimization using Prompt 2
➡ Keyword density + readability checks (metrics scripts)

5️⃣ Save outputs inside /samples/
📝 Sample Outputs

✔ article1_pillar.md — Pillar article sample
✔ article2_supporting.md — Supporting article sample

These demonstrate how the pipeline generates structured, human-readable content.
